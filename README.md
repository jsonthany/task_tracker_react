# Task Tracker <br />

#### Learning React by creating a simple task-tracker project. The task-tracker has the following functionalities:
- Add new task to the task tracker
- Set reminder for specified tasks (shown by colored line on the left hand side of each task)
- Delete tasks
- Prevents tasks with empty fields from being added
- Persist data via JSON (to imitate backend server environment)

###### *Side note on how to view the project locally: download the repository and type npm start to run the repository on local host*
